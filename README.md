<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: How to Deploy on-premises Active Directory within Azure Compute](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

Setup Domain Controller in Azure
—
Create a Resource Group - "Active-Directory-Lab"

Create the Domain Controller VM (Windows Server 2022) named “DC-1”<br />
After VM is created, set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static<br />

Set DC-1's NIC Private IP address to STATIC<br />

Setup Client-1 in Azure
Create the Client VM (Windows 10) named “Client-1”

Attach it to the same region and Virtual Network as DC-1
After VM is created, set Client-1’s DNS settings to DC-1’s Private IP address

Restart Client-1 from the Azure Portal, login and attempt to DC-1's private IP Address<br/>
If the ping succeeded, you have successfully configured Client-1 VM to use the DC as its DNS server.
